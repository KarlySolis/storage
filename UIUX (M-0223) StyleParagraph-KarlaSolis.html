  LOCATION. HOME. HOME<br><br>
  
  I walk through a city<br>
  that no longer inhabits me.<br><br>
  
  I touch it unpicked,<br>
  I and ants<br>
  from the bricks of the walls,<br>
  alarms ring<br>
  and sirens no longer answer<br>
  -if anything, ants have been growing<br>
  in every garden.<br><br>

  I could swear that everything has changed.<br>
  I could swear that before here<br>
  there was sea.<br>
  Or sky.<br><br>

  I would swear that I flew over this city<br>
  with more wings<br>
  than years.<br><br>

  When you leave,<br>
  you realize that home is not where you come from<br>
  nor where you're going.<br>
  We carry the house on our backs,<br>
  and sometimes they're so steep and narrow<br>
  that we abandon it halfway.<br><br>

  That's why,<br>
  when we lose ourselves<br>
  it is so hard to feel safe.<br><br>

  When one leaves<br>
  and returns to time,<br>
  it is with a different color of eyes,<br>
  with a different weight in your hands,<br>
  with a different taste in your back,<br>
  with a heart that beats as an emigrant.<br><br>

  When one leaves<br>
  and returns,<br>
  one finds a place made up and strange,<br>
  a city put on for others,<br>
  like that girl we rejected<br>
  and becomes, suddenly,<br>
  a precious being and unfit for us.<br><br>

  The relationship between a voluntary emigrant<br>
  and his city of origin<br>
  is like that of a couple that grew up together<br>
  and wanted to love each other all their lives only to abandon each other later:<br>
  the residue of a love that seemed to be eternal<br>
  and of a rupture that was declared inevitable.<br><br>

  Not all the places from which one leaves pause<br>
  nor all the people one abandons stay.<br><br>
  
  But to you I could say<br>
  that I will make any place that licks your footprints<br>
  your home.<br><br>
  
  To you I could say<br>
  that if someday you leave me<br>
  I'll stand in front of you<br>
  right in that precise place<br>
  that will never allow you<br>
  to look back with sorrow.<br><br>
  
  To you I could say<br>
  that you must know that you already occupy my eyes,<br>
  that I carry your laughter embedded in my arteries,<br>
  that there is no place in my body where your sorrow does not fit,<br>
  that when you have no place to return to<br>
  think that you have all my holes open.<br><br>
  
  To you I could say<br>
  that if one day you feel lost<br>
  inside yourself,<br>
  I will find the solution to your labyrinth<br>
  by opening my chest<br>
  and putting you in front of me,<br>
  right in that place where I talk so much about you that it won't be<br>
  that it won't cost you any effort to recognize yourself<br>
  and find you again.<br><br>
  
  To you I could say<br>
  that for me<br>
  any place<br>
  is my home<br>
  if it is you<br>
  who opens<br>
  the door.
